## with Markdown, GitHub and Jupyter/Colab

### Four Techniques to get into effective Technical Discussions:
**1. GitHub & Markdown**

Ni buat biar ga ada garbage files like `.pyc`

* Markdown URL format: `[Hyperlink](URL)`

**2. Gist**

* Can share very small Code Snippet, auto Syntax-formatted, people can Comment
* Can be either Public Gist / Secret Gist
* Can be communicated through many ways, i.e.
	- Embed
	- Share
	- Clone via HTTPS
	- Clone via SSH

**3. Colab & Jupyter**
* Easy to create Complex and Reproducible Code
* Creates `.ipynb` files

_* Hosted version of Jupyter: Colab_

* Useful for Data Science projects
* Easily shared to anyone just like GDocs

How to do:
```
