# Cloud Dev with Azure Cloud Shell

* Azure got highly connected data centers with Shell environment. 
* Inside Shell, got access for:
  1. Network
  2. Data Center
  3. proper Roles
  4. Storage
  5. can deploy PaaS (Platform as a Service) app

## Options to consider when opening Shell:
1. Storage? will storage be needed? if yes:
   * Choose a Storage account subscription
   * Setup Mount storage account
     * for now, I chose "we will deploy for you"

2. whether will use Existing Private Virtual Network or not
