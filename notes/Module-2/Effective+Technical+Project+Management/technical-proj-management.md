# How to Juggle as Project Manager

## 1. Create Q-Plans

## 2. Do Weekly Demo in Company
Effective to make Progress and how to Get things done

## 3. Understand DevOps
* Key is to understand what Continuous Delivery (CD) does in a Project -- as in, ability to Always Deploy Code, anytime.
* Kind of like paying Divident / Investing for the future

## 4. Think about things in a 4-hour to 3-day window
* Especially for project managed using Ticketing Systems
* In one-week / two-week cycle -- can go and put the Thought Pieces up and Set up Realistic Schedule
* Have Todo List, Progress List, Done List -- keep it Simple 
	--> List becomes Doing it, Haven't Done it, It's Done

## 5. Not Create a Process Designed to Have a Hero Come In and Save The Day
* Can be toxic in that the work actually credited to the hero instead of the actual person doing the work
* Kaizen: Better to have Predictable and Less Heroic process
* Essentially, continuous improvement on a Daily Basis
