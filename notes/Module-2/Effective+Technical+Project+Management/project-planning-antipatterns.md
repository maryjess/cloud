# Project Management Anti-Patterns
basically Red Flags that must be avoided in a project

## 1. Hero Driven Development
"Hero" constantly saving the day, hence building toxic culture in an organisation
That "hero" could get burnt out and eventually might quit, not good in the long run

Also shows that there is no "drive / rigor" to the way everything is done each week

## 2. Crisis Driven Development
Could possibly happen in teams with small people, where one did a mistake--
then the other members do "Root Cause Analysis" to fix the problem, BUT happens every single week or recurrently

**Step back, solve why you get into that crisis**

## 3. HiPPO Driven Development
HiPPO == Highest-Paid Person (e.g. a High High Executive)'s Opinion
(All) inputs must be baked out into a process -- not accounting out the people(s) giving opinion beforehand
and (mentang mentang) HiPPO gives opinion, the "beforehand opinion" is disregarded --> destructive pattern.

## 4. Heavy Scrum
All time spent uselessly into "some" Process

**The lighter the Process, the Better** --hits me.

## 5. Faith in People vs Faith in Process
Good to have VERY SMALL but effective process, and not only believe people
--Doesn't mean should not trust people, but every team has Needs to deliver within an Amount of Time

**Develop a process where Incremental Results are shown**
**Sometimes hope should not always be a Strategy (still beneficial to have), but should still keep Progressing**
