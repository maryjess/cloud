# Effective Critical Thinking
Some aspects of Critical Thinking:

1. Intellectual Humility
- Ability to realise that one isn't all the time right
- Many times one could have a blind spot or some kind of bias
- "Stay foolish, stay hungry" --Steve Jobs

2. Courage
- Have courage and fight for what you believe in, based on your reasonings

3. Empathy
- Basically putting yourself in other's shoe
- Understand why `that other party`'s viewpoint
--> Will be easier to compromise on a direction where both parties (you and that other party) can move forward

4. Autonomy
- To independently come up with own ideas
- Basically being independent

5. Integrity
- To play fair when you want to win someone's argument
- Not using tricks (aka deliberately misinforming people) for others to 'buy' your viewpoint

6. Perseverance
- What more can I say? Haha
- Tekunlah bro.

7. Confidence in Reason
- "Do you have what it takes to move stronger?"

8. Fair Mindedness
- Accept all different viewpoints, in order to evaluate for the best solution
