## 1. Clear, Elevating Goal
Goal must be specific

Structure must be result-oriented
Such that people achieving your goal and you can both measure the steps you are taking

## 3. Competent Team Members
Pick your team

## 4. Unified Commitment
Check whether got "checked-out" or "retired in place" team players
All players including you have to be unified in the Problem that the team is solving

Build collaborative culture in team so that teamwork gets rewarded
Uncollaborative environment where any teamplayer is not transparent to the teamleader may result in bad outcome

## 6. Standards of Excellence
Basically SOP (Standard Operation Procedure) where Everyone agrees what "Good" is

## 7. External Support and Recognition
The upper level recognises the lower level through creating Environment that the lower level can thrive in

## 8. Principal Leadership
Leader has to have Character (got to have clear principles) so that can give inspiration to others as well (not only limited to their lower level)
